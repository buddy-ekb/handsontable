This is an adopted Handsontable repository with few impovements.

One can always build a custom release of the library (see https://handsontable.com/docs/latest/tutorial-custom-build.html for details):

- Install Node.js >=10 for building and testing.
- Clone a Handsontable repository.
- Run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies defined in ```package.json```.
- Run ```npm run build``` to make your build.

Please refer to original [Handsontable](//github.com/handsontable/handsontable) for further details.
